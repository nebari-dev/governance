# Roadmap - 2022

> **Archived.** This roadmap covered Nebari Classic, the single monolithic platform
> shipped from one repository. That architecture has been replaced by the Nebari
> Kubernetes Platform, so this document is kept as history and is not maintained.
> See the [current platform roadmap](../roadmap.md) for cross-cutting direction, and a
> pack's own repository for its detailed plans.

## Themes for 2022

For 2022, we'll particularly focus on the following themes.

### Engineering

- ✅ - Improve team’s overall software development practices
- ✅ - Improve our GitHub practices and efficiency
  - ✅ - Unify issues, PRs and RFCs into issue boards
  - ✅ - Reevaluate the use of bots, pre-commits, and other automations → they should help make the development process more efficient (i.e. instead of blocking contributions or adding unnecessary noise)
  - ✅ - Adopt the use of `gitlab-flow` moving forward
  - ✅ - Create triaging guidelines
- ✅ - Document and streamline our release process
  - ✅ - Automate the creation of release checklists and document all the to-release steps
  - ✅ - Migrate from `SemVer` to `CalVer` (Done with the Nebari rename in October 2022)
- 🗃 - adopt overall development and structure standards
  - 🗃 - All repos must have an [architecture.md](http://architecture.md) or source code organisation guide
  - 🏗 - Adopt and document coding guidelines
  - ✅ - Standardize the use of labels, milestones, and templates

### User experience

- 🏗️ - Improve our overall users’ experience
  - 🗃 - Standardize feedback and user research processes
  - ✅ - Adopt a user design first approach
  - ✅ - Refactor the Nebari CLI
  - ✅ - Simplify the first deployment experience for new users
- 🏗 - Major updates to the documentation
  - ✅ - Audit current documentation and identify gaps and outdated content
  - ✅ - Adopt the Diataxis framework

  - ✅ - Create supporting material such as schematics and other diagrams

> **Note**
> While many items in the documentation section are marked as **complete** there is still a lot of work to be done to improve the overall documentation experience. We will continue to work on this in 2022-2023.

### Performance and stability

- 🏗️ - Ensure all the current integrations are workings, they have corresponding documentation and are tested accordingly

  - 🗃 - Ensure we are not using long-lived credentials
  - 🗃 - Introduce DevSecOps practices
- 🗃 - Refactor our CI/CD pipelines
  - 🗃 - Identify bottlenecks and opportunities for improvements
  - 🗃 - Critical deployments and other releases require `code owner` approval
  - 🏗️ - Reduce re-creation of artifacts and unnecessary runs
- 🗃 - Decentralize development and deployment
  - ✅  - One repository == one single product/scope (i.e. docker-images) should be outside the main repository
  - 🗃 - All deployments should have a `staging` → `production` pattern

### Community support and governance

- 🏗 - Improve our maintenance practices and OSS citizenship
  - ✅ - Create teams with defined scopes and responsibilities (GitHub)
