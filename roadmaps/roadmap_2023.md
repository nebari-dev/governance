# Roadmap - 2023

> **Archived.** This roadmap covered Nebari Classic, the single monolithic platform
> shipped from one repository. That architecture has been replaced by the Nebari
> Kubernetes Platform, so this document is kept as history and is not maintained.
> See the [current platform roadmap](../roadmap.md) for cross-cutting direction, and a
> pack's own repository for its detailed plans.
