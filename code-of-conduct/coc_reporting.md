# Code of Conduct: Incident reporting guidelines

## Report an incident

You can file a Code of Conduct incident report using this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/PFHmsMUiu12qJwWV7_). This will share your report with the [CoC committee](./coc_enforcement.md#the-code-of-conduct-committee), and they will contact you promptly.

## Alternate contact points

If you do not feel comfortable using the form, you can contact anyone on the [CoC committee directly, using the email addresses shared in the Enforcement manual](./coc_enforcement.md#the-code-of-conduct-committee). You can do this if the incident involves someone on the CoC committee.

## What to do if someone is in physical danger

If you believe someone is in physical danger, please contact the appropriate emergency responders.
