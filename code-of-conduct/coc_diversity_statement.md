# Code of Conduct: Diversity statement

Nebari welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a community that everyone enjoys being part of. Although we may not always be able to accommodate each individualâ€™s preferences, we try our best to treat everyone kindly.

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honor diversity in: age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race, religion (or lack thereof), sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability, to the extent that these do not conflict with this code of conduct.

Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, Nebari development is conducted in English.

Standards for behavior in the Nebari community are detailed in the [Code of Conduct details](./coc_details.md). Participants in our community should uphold these standards in all their interactions and help others to do so as well (see [reporting guidelines](./coc_reporting.md)).
