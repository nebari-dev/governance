# Roadmap - 2022

Our roadmap typically looks out 12-18 months, and we establish topics we want to work on.

We develop our roadmap based on the findings we made over the course of the last year,
and what we heard from the users and collaborators in issues, in face-to-face discussions, and other media.

When we execute on our roadmap, we keep learning and our assessment of some topics listed changes.
As a result, we may add or drop topics as we go. After around 12 months we come together to develop the next roadmap.

We describe some initiatives as "investigations" or "explorations" which means our goal in the next few months is to better understand the problem and potential solutions before scheduling actual feature work.
Once an investigation is done, we will update our plans, either deferring the initiative or committing to it.

## Values

Before we go into the details, let's start with our values that guide the development of Nebari.

- We strive for a smooth and productive experience for end-users - this places user experience at the core of everything we build.
- Performance trumps functionality.
- The documentation must be as transparent & accessible as possible.
- We build on open source software. In addition, any changes we make to open source software will be made in public and/or contributed upstream, so our users continue to have access to them regardless of where their infrastructure is.
- We must not directly depend on proprietary cloud vendor specific products or APIs. This ensures that users can port their infrastructure to any cloud provider of their choice, or run it on their own hardware with purely open source software.

(Definitions of `MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `SHOULD`, `MAY`, are defined in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119))

## Themes for 2022

For 2022, we'll particularly focus on the following themes.

### Engineering

- ✅ - Improve team’s overall software development practices
- 🏗️ - Improve our GitHub practices and efficiency
  - ✅ - Unify issues, PRs and RFCs into issue boards
  - 🏗 - Reevaluate the use of bots, pre-commits, and other automations → they should help make the development process more efficient (i.e. instead of blocking contributions or adding unnecessary noise)
  - ✅ - Adopt the use of `gitlab-flow` moving forward
  - 🏗 - Create triaging guidelines
- 🗃 - Document and streamline our release process
  - 🗃 - Automate the creation of release checklists and document all the to-release steps
  - ✅ - Migrate from `SemVer` to `CalVer` (Done with the Nebari rename in October 2022)
- 🗃 - adopt overall development and structure standards
  - 🗃 - All repos must have an [architecture.md](http://architecture.md) or source code organisation guide
  - 🏗 - Adopt and document coding guidelines
  - ✅ - Standardize the use of labels, milestones, and templates

### User experience

- 🏗️ - Improve our overall users’ experience
  - 🗃 - Standardize feedback and user research processes
  - ✅ - Adopt a user design first approach
  - 🏗️ - Refactor the Nebari CLI
  - ✅ - Simplify the first deployment experience for new users
- 🏗 - Major updates to the documentation
