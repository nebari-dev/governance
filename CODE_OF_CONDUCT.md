# Nebari Code of Conduct

Nebari is a community-oriented and community-led project.
We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience
We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching, and contributing.
Accordingly, everyone who participates in the Nebari project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times.

The [Nebari development team](https://github.com/orgs/nebari-dev/people) is dedicated to a ***harassment-free experience for everyone***, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. **We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form**.

We are particularly motivated to support new and/or anxious collaborators, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills, and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past.

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to this Code of Conduct.

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by Nebari including, but not limited to, in-person and online focus groups and workshops, and communications online via GitHub.

The [Nebari Code of Conduct committee](./coc_enforcement.md#the-code-of-conduct-committee) is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct.
A Code of Conduct incident report can be filed using this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/PFHmsMUiu12qJwWV7_).

Reports will be reviewed by members of this committee, unless there is a conflict of interest, and will be kept confidential.
If there is a conflict of interest, the member will remove themselves from relevant discussions.

The Code of Conduct document has been written in 4 parts:

* [Details](code-of-conduct/coc_details.md)
* [Diversity statement](code-of-conduct/coc_diversity_statement.md)
* [Incident reporting guidelines](code-of-conduct/coc_reporting.md)
* [Enforcement manual](code-of-conduct/coc_enforcement.md)

This code is adapted from the [Turing Way Code of Conduct](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coc.html), which is in-turn adapted from The Carpentries Code of Conduct with sections from the Alan Turing Institute Data Study Group Code of Conduct.

The diversity statement is adapted from the [Scipy Code of Conduct](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/dev/conduct/code_of_conduct.html#diversity-statement), which is under the BSD-3-Clause license.

The Carpentries Code of Conduct was adapted from guidelines written by the Django Project, which was itself based on the Ada Initiative template and the PyCon 2013 Procedure for Handling Harassment Incidents. Contributors to the the initial document are Adam Obeng, Aleksandra Pawlik, Bill Mills, Carol Willing, Erin Becker, Hilmar Lapp, Kara Woo, Karin Lagesen, Pauline Barmby, Sheila Miguez, Simon Waldman, and Tracy Teal. In 2018, the Code of Conduct was revised to add a summary, straightforward examples of both beneficial and unwanted behaviors, and evaluating intent. Reporting guidelines were also revised to include alternate contact points and a reporting form with the procedure was added. Contributors of these revised documents are Ethan White, Kari L. Jordan, Karin Lagesen, Malvika Sharan, Samantha Ahern, and Simon Waldman. Additional language was added by Otter Tech from the PyCon U.S. 2018 Code of Conduct (licensed CC BY 3.0).

The Turing Institute Data Study Group Code of Conduct was heavily adapted from the Citizen Lab Summer Institute 2017 Code of Conduct and used under a CC BY 2.5 CA license. Citizen Lab based their Code of Conduct on the xvzf Code of Conduct, the Contributor Covenant, the Django Code of Conduct and Reporting Guide and we are also grateful for this guidance from Ada Initiative.

We really appreciate the work that all of the communities linked above have put into creating such a well considered process.
